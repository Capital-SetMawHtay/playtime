Resolves #

Make sure you've covered the following bases in your PR. They won't all be
needed for every PR (ex. fixing a straightforward rubocop issue might have no
tradeoffs and add no dependencies).

- [ ] Did you fill in the `Resolves #<issue number>` in the first line?
- [ ] Is this a work in progress? If so, put "WIP" in the title.
- [ ] What were the main changes/goals of this PR?
- [ ] Did you need to make any tradeoffs? Why did you make the choice you made?
- [ ] Did you add any dependencies?
- [ ] Anything else we should know about?
